This could be integrated in you armor/weapon/shield/accessory (without taking a slot), or it could be a separate item entirely. How you carry it is purely for flavour purposes, it doesn't take up inventory space or your held item slot.\n- Lasts for the entire quest when activated, start to finish (Even whon KOd and revived).\n- GM determines how many are allowed within quest post.\n- Does **NOT** prevent you from also using a Z-Move.\n- There is **no cost** for having it active, except for taking up one of the allowed megas the GM permitted.\n\nThis has to be posted on <#1271585309595009074> for proper approval, can be started when your Char hits Level 11.",
