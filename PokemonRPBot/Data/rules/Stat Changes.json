  "text": "- Stat Changes may stack up to a maximum of +/- 3.\n- Stat Changes will impact the number of dice rolled for accuracy, but confer a flat bonus/penalty to damage rolls. All Foes/Area/Multi-Hit attacks instead resolve damage as if the changes were directly to the pokemon's base stats. \n- Critical hits on Stat Change Support moves apply/reduce one additional stat point, but not past the limit! If it would boost multiple stats, you get to choose one which will receive the crit bonus.\n- Stat Changes to Defense and Special Defense confer a bonus/penalty to the User's Vitality and Insight rolls respectively.\n- Effects that specify changes to a pokemon's base stat impact the stat directly, changing the number of accuracy/damage dice rolled. Effects on a pokemon's base stat are not subject to the +/- 3 limitation of Stat Changes, (and consequently stack with Stat Change effects) and are not copied or stolen by moves/effects which impact a pokemon's Stat Changes.\n- Defense and Special Defense cannot go below 0, combat stats can't go below 1.\n- Stat Changes incurred by the same effect (ex: move, ability, item) may only alter stats once unless otherwise specified. The same effects performed by a different source can still affect the target.",
