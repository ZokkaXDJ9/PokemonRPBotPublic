  "text": "Weather is a battlefield effect that can be set by that like others, affects all combatants in a battle. Unless stated otherwise by the GM, only one Weather can be in effect at a time. A Weather is removed from play via one of three ways, those being: \n- the Round counter for a Weather reaches its end\n-  Special circumstances\n- the original one to have set the weather fails a Weather Control roll against another character attempting to set a different Weather. \nWeather Control rolls are a competition roll between the one in control of the current Weather (or GM if it was set beforehand for story reasons and is changeable) and a character attempting to replace it with their own different Weather. Each participant rolls their Vitality or Insight (participant choice) with Rank against each other and tallying up the successes. The participant with more successes is the victor and sets/resets their weather on the field. In the case of a tie, the original Weather stays but keeps its Round timer.",
  "example": "A Tinkaton tries to set it's weather over a Vaporeon. Both roll their Vitality or Insight with Rank against each other then get 3 and 4 successes respectively, meaning that the Vaporeon wins and resets their weather to 0/4 turns. \nFor another example, a Sneasler and Shinx are competing in a Weather Control roll. They each get 6 Successes meaning the Sneasler keeps their weather active but still has it at 3/4 Rounds."
