  "name": "Flash Fire",
  "description": "This Pokemon is capable of consuming other fire sources and adding them to its own. Walking through embers, fire, lava and hell feel like a breeze to it.",
  "effect": "The first time this Pokemon is hit by a Fire-Type move, add 1 Extra Die to the Damage Pool of Fire-type Moves this Pokemon uses until the end of the scene. Fire-type moves do not deal damage to this Pokemon. Will-O-Wisp activates this ability and the User is unaffected."
