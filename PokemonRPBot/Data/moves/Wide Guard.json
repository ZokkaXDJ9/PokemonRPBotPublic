Reduce the damage the User and Allies would take from \"All Foes\" or \"Area\" moves by an amount equal to the User's Rank minus the number of rounds this move has been used consecutively by the user. Reduce minimum damage to 0. Prevent all secondary effects that would trigger on the User and Allies by guarded moves. Wide Guard may also instead be used to negate one \"All Foes\" targeting support move. Z-Moves resolve normally, only taking into account the damage reduction of Wide Guard.",
